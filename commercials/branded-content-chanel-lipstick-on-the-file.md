# <center> I Can’t Live, If Living Is Without Chanel’s Le Vernis Nail Gloss 

![](/uploads/chanel-nail.jpg)

A little while back, our writer, Dom, wrote one of the most compelling, groundbreaking, important features to ever grace the pages of THE FILE. Titled ‘[The Best Podcasts To Paint Your Talons To](http://the-file.com/roundup/podcasts-to-paint-your-nails-to/),’ it seriously altered the course of lives everywhere. Now that she’s done the hard task of providing us with a bevvy of podcasts to devour, it’s time to get going on the second half of that story. Enter our this week’s hero product: [Chanel’s Le Vernis Nail Gloss](http://rstyle.me/n/cs5j2kbifuf) in shade *Rouge Radical*.

If the eyes are the window to the soul, then the condition of ours hands is a snapshot into the amount of time we allocate to self-grooming. For me, this has been teetering dangerously close to zero minutes per week. “Paint me like one of your French girls,” my chipped, jagged nails whisper to me as I click the next episode on Netflix, or Ctrl+T on my keyboard. “Okay,” I am only now whispering back, as I decide whether to start my podcast bender with a true crime story or a mediation on the guilt that often comes with being a millennial feminist.

I’ve already sung the praises of [Chanel’s Le Vernis Nail Colour in *Rose Confidentiel*](http://the-file.com/roundup/best-products-august-2017/), but, after expressing my desire to add more spice to my manicure, our Site Producer, Betsy, recommended I give *Rouge Radical* a red hot go. “It’s my favourite nail polish in the world. Try it,” she tells me on Slack. “Okay,” I write back, as if it’s the only word in the English language that I am capable of using.

My metrics for the perfect nail polish are as follows: colour, durability, and ability to hoodwink people into thinking I paid upwards of $50 for a manicure. Chanel is not stuffing around here with their claims of it being a “longwear” nail colour. In the same way I brutally and mysteriously murder footwear, I have a special gift for giving manicures a \~lived in\~ look within 12 hours of applying polish. The Le Vernis range is, in this sense, the steel-capped boot of nail varnish, and one of only a handful that can weather the effects of my unruly limbs. After applying one coat, I baked a cake. I washed up. I went to the beach. I really *lived*, you know? And guess what? I still looked like I’d just stepped out of the nail salon. Which brings me to my next point…

Like a good in-salon blow dry, it’s very hard to emulate a salon manicure at home if you don’t have the right tools. In my humble opinion, the right tools are: [Sally Hansen’s Instant Cuticle Remover](http://www.ulta.com/instant-cuticle-remover?productId=xlsImpprod2870037), a nail file, the [Mecca Max Nail Care Cube](http://www.mecca.com.au/mecca-max/nail-care-cube/I-026763.html), the [Orly Bonder basecoat, and, obvy](http://www.orlybeauty.com/nail-treatments/basecoats/bonder-131.html), *Rouge Radical*. Invest in these tools, and I promise you will feel as though you have just won a round of [Bullshit](https://australiancardgames.com.au/bullshit/) (the best card game to ever exist, in my dishonest opinion).

The final frontier is the colour. Anything red is a hard yes from me, especially when it comes to lips, nails, and T-shirts. If I were to have made a mood board for my exact dream nail colour/consistency, it would comprise exclusively of images of cans of diced tomatoes and close-ups of [Selena Gomez’s lips in the ‘Fetish’ video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXE0p_6lIkp/?hl=en&taken-by=the_file). I wanted something that communicated both “I’ve been to Tuscany” and “I’m fun-loving.” I wanted something that was neither too rich and full-bodied nor too weak (which oft happens with sheer, glossy formulas). I was after the Pinot Noir of nail polish, and this, my friends, is it. I applied two coats to get the desired colour, and, for one beautiful second, felt like Jeanne Damas. Purchase your own bottle [here](http://rstyle.me/n/cs5j2kbifuf), fire up your earphones, and get painting, ladiezzzz.
